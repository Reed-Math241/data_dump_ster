# data_dump_ster

This code was written to create a shiny app for my senior undergraduate thesis data. The app has a page on the background of the project for context. The code is very specific to the experimental design of my thesis work. The purpose of the app is to be able to visualize the data I collected in various ways. It allows the user to select different molecule treatments or experimental trials to better understand the data. The results of my thesis were unexpected. I predicted a dose dependent response, meaning higher concentrations of molecule should produce lower absorbance readings (fewer viable cells). It is useful to compare trials and molecule treatments to figure out which results were closest to this dose response.
