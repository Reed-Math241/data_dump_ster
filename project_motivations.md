# Motivations for This Project 
This page serves as a brief description of the presented data.
## Project Background
The data presented here was all experimentally derived from my senior undergraduate thesis at Reed College. My project was a year-long biological and chemical investigation of breast cancer treatment. Despite the advances made in breast cancer treatment in the past decades, it remains one of the most prevalent cancer among U.S. women (only following skin cancer), affecting over 40,000 women anually. Treatment with tamoxifen is the most commonly used treatment option. However, while it is effective in treating breast cancer, it greatly increases chances of developing endometrial cancer. These longterm effects demonstrate the need for a safer treatment option that maintains the effectiveness of tamoxifen in treating breast tumors. My senior thesis tested four newly synthesized molecules that were designed based on ample literature citing molecular features of tamoxifen that make it succesful and other features that contribute to its proliferative effects on the endometrium. 
### How I did it
To test these new molecules, I utilized a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7 cells). I took these cells and treated them with various concentrations of the new drugs (molecules). The molecules tested were: rkl04-24, rkl04-26, 4ht and rkl02-82. 4ht is equivalent to tamoxifen and was used as a comparison throughout all experiments. The experiments tested different concentrations of the molecules in hopes of finding a concentration at which all the breast cancer cells were killed. The way I measured how many cells were alive and dead after being treated with the molecules was through a measurement of active cellular metabolism. The experiment I used, functions by treatment with pigmented substances that change pigment based on how many cells are metabolizing it. Thus, I was able to measure the color of solution after drug treatment to figure out how many cells were alive and how many were dead. This value is represented by absorbance in my data. The lower the absorbance, the less living cells there are. We expect lower absorbances at higher molecule concentrations. An image of the experimental setup can be seen below

### What Do The Trials Mean?
Each trial was a different round of experiments. They are separated because the treatments in each were slightly different. Take a look at the different trials to see what experimental components I changed. 

### What is the DMSO control?
The DMSO controls were included in my experiments because all the molecules had to be dissolved in this substance: DMSO. While DMSO is great at solubilizing compounds, it can do weird things to cells, like cause them to die or grow, depending on the concentration at which it's present. Because of this, I always tested DMSO on cells without drugs to compare to the drug treatments. The DMSO "hi" concentrations correspond to the highest amount of DMSO present in any given drug treatment and "low" concentrations correspond to the lowest amount present. We hope to see no difference in cell only treatments and DMSO controls. This would mean that the dissolving substance is not having an effect on cell death, and that the results we observe really are due to the drug treatments.
